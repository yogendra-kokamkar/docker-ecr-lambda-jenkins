# AWS Lambda Hello World with Dockerized Deployment

This repository contains a simple "Hello World" program written in Python for AWS Lambda. Additionally, it includes a Dockerfile to containerize the pythom program, and the deployment process is automated through a Jenkins CI/CD pipeline. The Docker image is pushed to AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry), and an AWS Lambda function is created using the ECR image.
